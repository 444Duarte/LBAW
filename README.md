A9: High-level architecture. Privileges. Web resources specification

This artefact presents an overview of the web resources to implement organized into modules. The permissions used in the modules to establish the conditions of access to resources are also presented.

For each module identified in the artefact, a catalog of web resources that are part of the module, including possible APIs, must be presented. For each resource, the expected URL, HTTP methods and parameters supported as well as possible responses should be included. For resources with a user interface, include a reference to the corresponding graphical interface defined in A3 artefact.

An example which illustrates the documentation of a module (A9 and A11 artefacts) is available: Web Resources Documentation.
